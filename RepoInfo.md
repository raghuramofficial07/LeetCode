## » Repository Purpose
This repository is a **curated collection of algorithm solutions, structured explanations, and code examples**.  
Each solution emphasizes:
- Clear logic
- Efficient implementations
- Beginner-friendly explanations
- Consistent documentation style

The goal is to **bridge the gap between learning and applying algorithms**, especially for students and early-career developers.

---

## » Problem Domains
This repository covers problems in:
- **Dynamic Programming**
- **Combinatorics and Pascal's Triangle**
- **Array Manipulation**
- **Mathematical Recurrence**
- **Basic Data Structures**

Each topic is presented with:
- Clean, well-commented C++ examples
- Step-by-step derivations
- Reference tables

---

## » Code Standards
All code in this repository follows:
- **Consistent naming conventions**
- **Clear separation of logic and output**
- **Avoidance of unnecessary memory allocations (when possible)**
- **Compatibility with modern C++ compilers**

Where applicable, alternative solutions (e.g., optimized space or time) are also discussed.

---

## » Documentation Philosophy
All content is presented in a **mono-chrome markdown style** with:
- Clear headings (`»`)
- Code examples in dedicated sections
- Under-the-hood breakdowns
- Concept highlights
- Real-world use cases

This structure is designed to make the material **easy to read, reference, and reuse**.

---

## » Contribution Guidelines
If you wish to contribute:
- Follow the established documentation format.
- Ensure code is commented thoroughly.
- Keep solutions beginner-friendly.
- Use the same markdown section naming.
